    "The traceback tells us that this exception occurred in a file called **main.py**. If you’re on **repl.it**, remember that this is the file that always get run when we press the “Run” button. It also tells us that the exception occurred on line 1. On the next line, it tells us what the problematic code is. In our case, this is the reference to the variable, name.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Under the traceback, we have the name of the exception that occurred (a NameError in our case), along with some message explaining the exception in more detail. As we can see, the problem is that name is not defined. In other words, we haven’t told Python what name means in our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s another situation where a NameError might occur, so let’s take a look at that:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(hourly_wage * hours_worked)\n",

    "\n",
    "The reason we’re getting this error is because Python is running our code top to bottom. When it encounters print(hourly_wage * hours_worked) on line 1, it doesn’t yet know that we’ve defined hourly_wage and hours_worked later in the code. For this reason, we have to make sure to always define our variables before we use them in the code. If we don’t, Python is going to raise a NameError exception, just like we’ve seen in these examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting values from the user\n",
    "So far we’ve provided all the values in our Python code, but sometimes we need to get values from the user instead. For example, maybe we want to get the user’s name and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily we don’t have to implement something like this from scratch, because Python comes with another function to do this exact job. This function is called input.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call input in exactly the same way as print, we just need to write the function name and put opening and closing parentheses directly after:\n",
    "\n",
    "input()\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run the code above, you won’t see anything in the console, but if you look at the “Run” button in repl.it, you’ll see that it says “Stop”. This means the program is still running. You’ll also find that you can type in the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you press enter, the program will end. That’s because when you press enter, the input function is going to stop accepting user input. Since we have no other code in our program, Python then runs out of code to execute, and terminates the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we can call input by just writing input(), usually we’re going to want to provide some kind of prompt, for the user to know what we want from them. Your first instinct might be to do something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Please enter your name:\")\n",
    "input()\n",
    "\n",
    "That’ll certainly work, but input is actually capable of providing its own prompt. We just need to write the desired prompt inside the parentheses when we call the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "input(\"Please enter your name:\")\n",
    "\n",
    "I’d encourage you to run that line of code for yourself, because there’s a bit of a problem. At the moment, the user is writing directly next to the colon I added at the end of the prompt. In order to avoid this, make sure you put a space or two at the end of your prompts. It’s going to make a big difference to the user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n",
    "\n",
    "The final piece of the puzzle is storing this value somewhere. Remember that function calls are expressions, and therefore evaluate to some value. The input function evaluates to a string which contains whatever the user wrote in response to the prompt. We can therefore assign this string to a variable if we want, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "name = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n",

    "Investigate what happens when you try to assign a value to a variable that you’ve already defined. Try printing the variable before and after you reuse the name.\n",
    "Below you’ll find some code with a number of errors. Try to go through the program line by line and fix the issues in the code. I’d encourage you to try running the program while you’re working on it, as reading the error messages is great practice for debugging your own programs.\n",

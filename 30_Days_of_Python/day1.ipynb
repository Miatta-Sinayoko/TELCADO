    "One of the main strengths of Python is the readability of its code, which makes it extremely accessible. Often Python code reads just like English. Python is also extremely flexible, and can be found in a wide range of industries, from machine learning to web development.\n",

    "At the time of writing there are two major Python standards in active use.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The second branch of Python is Python 3, with the most current version being Python 3.9. Python 3 was intended to be a replacement for Python 2, and boasts a number of improvements along with some significant syntax changes. Code written in Python 2 may not be compatible with Python 3, and even if the code runs we may end up with unexpected behaviour.\n",
